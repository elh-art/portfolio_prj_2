# portfolio project 2 (Crypto & S&P500 combined Fear & Greed index indicator)

This little application shows data from two different APIs. The "crypto" button is fetching data from Crypto Fear & Greed Index. The "S&P500" is from CNN‚Äôs Fear & Greed Index. The user can adjust which days' value is visible in the lower switch-table. üí∏

I based the project on a clock application by Traversy Media. ‚è∞

I used async/await promises to fetch data from the APIs.

CSS variables handle the dark/light mode switch.

The application is mobile-friendly. üì±
